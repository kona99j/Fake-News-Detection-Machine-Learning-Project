# Fake-News-Detection-Machine-Learning-Project


Collected and cleaned news articles, performing text preprocessing such as tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key word patterns and understand differences between real and fake news content.

Built and evaluated machine-learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest for text classification.

Improved model performance through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to increase overall classification accuracy.

Assessed model effectiveness using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization.

Developed a prediction pipeline that takes raw text as input and classifies it as real or fake in real time.
